This toolset build is inspired by INetSim and "Black Hat Python".
This is an active repository that will have many cross platform python networking tools to help with various pentesting attacks and support malware analysis by responding to various server request.

LeatherCat: is a Client/Server backdoor with CMD/Shell abilities. Requires that the host has python installed. Works great for injecting files to execute and relaying commands in the case of a remote computer that dosn't have shell/cmd access but has python installed. 

TCP/UDP server/clients: Are basic but working tools that will be improved and added to, over time, as I need fit.
